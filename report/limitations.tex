This implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm has two main limitations. First is the restrictive rules. Since the algorithm is designed to optimize for the specific set of rules, it cannot be easily applied to speed up other rule sets. In other words, the proposed solutions are not general to all Wave Function Collapse algorithms. 

The second weakness of this algorithm is the oversight in how CUDA is not entirely suitable for this problem. In more general implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, processes are highly divergent and very dependent on results from previous iterations. The simplified set of rules allowed CUDA GPUs to accelerate part of the propagation but the lack of concurrent warps limits the effectiveness of GPU utilization.
