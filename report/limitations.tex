This implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm has two main limitations. First is the restrictive rules. Since the algorithm is designed to optimize for the specific set of rules, it cannot be easily applied to speed up other rule sets. In other words, the proposed solutions are not general to all Wave Function Collapse algorithms. However, the concept of boundary setting and independent local wave function collapse can still be useful in future implementation. 

The second weakness of this implementation is that the CUDA version requires that the entire map and wave information to be in GPU memory during execution. In low VRAM hardware such as those with 1GB or 2GB of GPU memory, large problem size may result in errors. In this implementation, the remedy is using the CUDA implementation in conjunction with MPI.
