In 2019, a team of students attempted to parallelize the algorithm using different approaches \cite{JanAmy2019}.They used OpenMP and P-Threads in combination with Queues. Their results showed that the algorithm can be parallelized with relatively high scaling efficiency. However, it also revealed that an observer-based approach with sequential queue for execution shows the most speedup when compared to parallelizing the work on all cells. 

In this project, I aim to investigate parallelizing the wave function collapse algorithm using CUDA since CUDA has many more cores compared to multiprocessing on CPU, the brute-force approach on CUDA may still be beneficial over CPU with a faster algorithm.

Since the next iteration is based on changes from adjacent cells, this is very similar to Conway's game of life \cite{games1970fantastic}, where the livelihood of cells in the next iteration are entirely based on the cells surrounding it in the current iteration. Implementation of this game using image convolution and utilizing GPU shader processing units has been proven possible \cite{nicholasrui_2017}. This project also tries to utilize multiple GPU by using MPI, which can further speed up the process.
